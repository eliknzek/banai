# BanAI — AI Wardrobe Designer

An MVP for designing standard straight wardrobes with three synchronized parts:
- a conversational AI agent
- a manual properties editor
- a dimensionally accurate Three.js viewer

All three edit **one canonical design state** through the same typed operations.

## Features

- **3D viewer:**
  - Orbit and zoom around the wardrobe, and click any component to select it.
  - Live dimension labels in cm.
  - A "Show interior" toggle hides the doors.
- **Properties editor:**
  - Overall size, doors (hinged, sliding or none), materials, colours and finishes.
  - Compartments, shelves, drawers and hanging rails.
  - Every edit is validated, and an invalid value never changes the design.
- **AI Designer chat:**
  - Describe the wardrobe in Hebrew or English, and the agent replies with a **proposal**.
  - Nothing changes until you press **Confirm**.
  - Proposals are HMAC-signed, re-validated on the server, and rejected if the design changed in the meantime.
- **Voice:**
  - Hold the mic to talk (push-to-talk), in Hebrew or English. Your words are transcribed and sent as a chat message, and the result is still a proposal you confirm.
  - Replies are read aloud in an AI-generated voice, and the text appears together with the voice. There is a mute switch.
- **Hebrew by default:** a right-to-left interface in natural Hebrew, with a live switch to English.
  - In Hebrew, compartments, partitions and doors are numbered from the right.
- **Photoreal render:** an illustrative image of exactly the current design. The design itself never changes.
- **Carpenter spec (PDF):** after a render, download or share (via the device share sheet) a 4-page build spec:
  - the render and a summary
  - a dimensioned front drawing
  - the parts as designed
  - suggested hardware and an assembly order

  It is **not** a manufacturing drawing: there is no cut list and no CNC output, and every page says so.
- **Design-only scope:** the agent declines anything that isn't about wardrobe design.

## How it works

```
 chat (OpenAI) ──► signed proposal ──► Confirm ──┐
 properties editor ──► ops ──────────────────────┼──► ops engine ──► canonical design ──► Three.js viewer
                                                 │    (validated)
```

- **One op protocol.** Every change is a list of pure, typed ops such as `update_dimensions`, `configure_doors`, `add_shelf` or `set_material`.
  - The Python engine in `backend/app/domain/` is authoritative.
  - The JS mirror in `frontend/src/domain/` gives instant manual edits.
  - Shared golden fixtures keep the two engines in sync.
- **Units.** All lengths are integer millimetres. The UI shows cm.
- **Stateless AI proposals.**
  - `POST /api/chat` returns `{reply, proposal}`. The proposal is signed over `{ops, baseRevision, baseHash}`.
  - `POST /api/proposals/apply` verifies the signature and returns **409** if the proposal is stale.
- **Rendering.** The viewer renders from state only; it never owns data.
- **Voice.** A chained pipeline: speech-to-text, then the same `/api/chat`, then text-to-speech. Speech never bypasses the signed proposal.

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `backend/` | FastAPI + Pydantic API and AI agent (Python 3.13, managed by `uv`) |
| `frontend/` | Vanilla JS + Three.js, bundled with Vite |
| `shared/fixtures/` | Golden fixtures used by both test suites |
| `supabase/` | Supabase CLI config and SQL migrations |
| `docs/` | Architecture, schema, frontend and infra docs, plus screenshots |
| `.claude/` | Claude Code project settings and the Obsidian work-log Stop hook |

## Local development

Prerequisites: Python 3.13, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), Node 22+.

```bash
# Backend (http://localhost:8000)
cd backend
cp .env.example .env        # add OPENAI_API_KEY to enable the AI Designer
uv sync
uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Frontend (http://localhost:5173)
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
npm ci
npm run dev
```

## Configuration

**Backend** (`backend/.env`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | Enables the AI Designer. Without it, the chat says the agent isn't connected. |
| `OPENAI_CHAT_MODEL` | Chat model, for example `gpt-5.4`. A configurable default. |
| `OPENAI_IMAGE_MODEL` | Model for the photoreal render. The default is `gpt-image-2.5-sunburst`. |
| `OPENAI_STT_MODEL` / `OPENAI_TTS_MODEL` / `OPENAI_TTS_VOICE` | Voice models and voice. The defaults are `gpt-transcribe`, `gpt-4o-mini-tts` and `cedar`. |
| `PROPOSAL_SIGNING_KEY` | HMAC key for proposals. Required outside `APP_ENV=local`. |
| `CORS_ORIGINS` | Allowed frontend origins, comma-separated. |
| `APP_ENV` | Set to `local`, `dev` or `production`. API docs are disabled in production. |

**Frontend** (`frontend/.env`):

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | Backend URL, read at build time. |

Never commit `.env` files. The repository is public.

## Testing

```bash
cd backend  && uv run pytest              # backend unit + API tests
cd frontend && npm test                   # frontend unit tests (vitest)
cd frontend && npx playwright test        # end-to-end tests (starts its own servers)
```

Playwright E2E tests never call OpenAI. The backend runs with `APP_ENV=e2e`, which uses scripted fakes for the agent, the voice and the images.

## Environments

| Railway environment | Git branch | Services (root dir) |
|---|---|---|
| `production` | `main` | `frontend` (`/frontend`), `backend` (`/backend`) |
| `dev` | `dev` | `frontend` (`/frontend`), `backend` (`/backend`) |

- All work lands on `dev`.
- Merging to `main` deploys production, and only happens with explicit approval.
- See `docs/railway.md`.
